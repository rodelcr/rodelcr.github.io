2024/09: AAS 245th Meeting Oral Presentation - <a href="aa">Black Hole Growth and Connections to Dark Matter Halos: New insights from Wide-field Cosmological Surveys</a>






I recently gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_ayMt8E5c">TED talk</a> about the ways we interpret the masses of galaxies, and how these measurements are helping us understand the evolution of quasars (image courtesy of Sam Cohen, TEDxMahwah). For three years, I worked with the Princeton University Preparatory Program (PUPP) doing afternoon enrichment sessions (developing critical reading, presentation, and argumentative skills) in local highschools in central New Jersey for underserved student populations. I've also been proud to partner with HISPA (Hispanics Inspiring Students’ Performance and Achievement) to educate more students about the preparation and path to be a scientist. I also like to write about astronomy in the most-circulated Puerto Rican newspaper, el Nuevo Día. You can find clippings of my articles and their translations <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YD75A-IMlx4lFywhc-yM-L9Q_g0DcvrZ?usp=share_link">here</a>.
