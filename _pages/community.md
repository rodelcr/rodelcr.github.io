One of my favorite parts about being a scientist is getting to communicate our passion for the cosmos and all its wonderful mysteries with the public. I especially enjoy sharing the little we've learned about our place in the universe with young people in places like Puerto Rico and the Osage Nation reservation.

I have been very happy to contribute to STEAM Teaching at Arecibo (STAR) Academy, where we've worked on a range of presentations for middle-high schoolers to learn about modern and ancient astronomy. 


I've produced a series of lectures developed alongside elders and language instructors for elementary and middle school astronomy classes in 𐓏𐒰𐓓𐒰𐓓𐒷 𐒻𐒷, the Osage Language. You can read more about this work in a recent press review [here](https://osagenews.org/giving-back-osage-and-the-stars/).


I've also been proud to partner with HISPA (Hispanics Inspiring Students’ Performance and Achievement) to educate more students about the preparation and path to be a scientist.

I recently gave a TED talk about the ways we interpret the masses of galaxies, and how these measurements are helping us understand the evolution of quasars. Video will be uploaded soon!
