I'm Gabi, a theoretical physicist interested in cosmology and astrophysics. I'm currently a final-year PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Prof. Marc Kamionkowski](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kamionkowski/). My research aims to explore a wide range of emergent observational techniques to tackle long-standing questions about the origin, evolution, and composition of the Universe. I have so far focused on line-intensity mapping, pulsar timing arrays, and astrophysical probes of dark matter, which you can read more about in the [research](https://gsatopolito.github.io/research/) tab.

Before starting graduate school at JHU, I was an undergraduate in an [interdisciplinary sciences](https://cecm.usp.br/) program at Universidade de São Paulo, where I worked with [Prof. Raul Abramo](http://fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/index.html/Home.html) on the formation of large-scale structures in the matter distribution of the Universe.
