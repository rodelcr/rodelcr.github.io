I'm Gabi, a theoretical physicist interested in cosmology and astrophysics and I'm currently a postdoctoral member at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/scholars/gabriela-sato-polito). I received my PhD in 2023 from Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Prof. Marc Kamionkowski](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kamionkowski/). My research aims to explore novel observational techniques to tackle long-standing questions about the origin, evolution, and composition of the Universe, which you can read more about in the [research](https://gsatopolito.github.io/research/) tab.

Before starting graduate school at JHU, I was an undergraduate in an [interdisciplinary sciences](https://cecm.usp.br/) program at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, where I worked with [Prof. Raul Abramo](http://fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/index.html/Home.html) on the formation of large-scale structures in the matter distribution of the Universe.
