title: AGN clustering
description: Axions and axion-like particles are among the compelling dark-matter candidates. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11236">recent work</a>, we showed that a high-significance excess in the cosmic optical background measured by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft can be explained by an axion-like particle in a region of parameter space that was previously unconstrained. Motivated by this result, we then studied a similar parameter space through the attenuation of γ-rays from blazars.
