title: photometric quasar clustering
description: Using projected clustering statistics, we study the relationship between accreting black holes and galaxies, in order to learn about the dark matter halo masses occupied by the active galaxies and their black holes. We use machine learning techniques to identify a Hyper-Suprime Camera (HSC)-observed sample of ~ 34,000 quasars and examine how often they are near to one of ~ 1.7 million luminous red galaxies; this spatial correlation relates directly to the halo mass. Interestingly, we find a relationship between how dusty the active galaxy is and how massive is its halo, with the unobscured quasars residing in halos that are four-five times more massive than those around their obscured conterparts. This points us to think quasars may have more elaborate formation histories than what we already thought we knew.
