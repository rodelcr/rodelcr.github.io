title: spectroscopic follow-up of quasar clustering
description: We currently study the real-space spatial correlations between spectroscopically-observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by combing our HSC-derived quasar sample with Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey validation data. With this new information, we have precise redshifts and emission lines with which we can confirm the AGN classification. We're wrapping up the last steps of the analysis and are excited to share more in the coming months.
