title: Spectroscopic follow-up of HSC+WISE AGN
description: Pulsar timing arrays are expected to soon detect nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) and I'm interested in exploring new signatures that can be used to learn about the origin of such signal. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05867">recent publication</a>, we showed that the circular polarization of the GW background may be detectable and informative about the properties of the GW sources.
