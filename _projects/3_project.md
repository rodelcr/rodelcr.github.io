title: spectroscopic follow-up of quasar clustering
description: In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24020">CÃ³rdova Rosado et al. 2024c</a>, we studied the real-space spatial correlations between spectroscopically-observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by combing our HSC-derived quasar sample with Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey validation data. With this new information, we have precise redshifts and emission lines with which we can confirm the AGN classification. We find that although we don't have a large enough sample to independently confirm the halo mass difference with high statistical significance, we do find that the masses we do constrain are entirely consistent with our previous results, wherein unobscured (least dusty) AGN are in dark matter halos that are ~5 times larger than those that host obscured (dusty) AGN.
