title: Line-intensity mapping
description: LIM is an observational technique that targets atomic or molecular spectral lines. I'm interested in its potential to survey both the large-scale matter distribution and the astrophysical conditions of the interstellar and intergalactic medium across vast volumes of the Universe. I have worked on a variety of projects exploring how it can be used to learn about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08193">inflation</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08977">reionization</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11236">dark matter</a>, as well as developed a formalism to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02330">combine summary statistics</a> of LIM data.
