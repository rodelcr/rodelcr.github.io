title: power spectra of cosmic dust
description: In <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/acfe06">our paper</a>, we estimate the cross-power spectrum between mid-infrared (MIR) and sub-milimeter wavelength observations of 15% of the sky to infer the spatial correlations of cosmic dust (specifically for MIR-bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, and sub-micron sized grains). Taking WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) and ACT (Atacama Cosmology Telescope) observations, we characterize dust foregrounds. We find that dust power spectra do not follow a single power law slope, we detect the first significant cross correlation between the "cosmic PAH background" and the cosmic infrared background, and infer significant alignment between dust filaments and galactic magnetic fields down to sub-parsec scales.
