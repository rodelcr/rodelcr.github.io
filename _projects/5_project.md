title: interpreting the AGN halo distribution
description: In <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.11780">Córdova Rosado et al. 2025</a>, we additionally explored what halo occupation distribution (HOD) tools could tell us about our measured AGN photometric clustering from <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8342">Córdova Rosado et al. 2024b</a>. We learned that the intra-halo clustering, as well as the large-scale clustering, is significantly different for Type I and Type II AGN. This result challenges the standard unifed model of AGN morphology, and instead suggests that quasar spectral class could indicate different eras or scenarios of SMBH Accretion.
