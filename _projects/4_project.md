title: solar alignments in ancestral monumental architecture
description: Following from my time doing an MPhil in Archaeology of the Americas, I work on short projects that interface Archaeology and Astrophysics to learn more about the ways ancestral Indigenous communities embedded their knowledge of the sky into the structures they made. Our project identifying and interpreting a set of solar alignments in classic and pre-classic Mesoamerican monumental architecture is currently in review and we are excited to share the results soon!

I have also been working on developing interpretive frameworks for anthropological analyses of the influence of astronomical phenomena on the development of human culture and practice.
